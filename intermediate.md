## Prework

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) is a great resource for learning the syntax of different popular laguages, as well as familiarizing yourself with important tools. Make an account and get started coding now. Try to do at lease little bit every day, but don't be afraid to go on a binge.

[Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/) is another great resource for exposure to different subjects. Although not all subjects are free, the first lesson or two usually is.

#### For your prework \(\*\*work done before class starts\*\*\) you are to do:

This is what you can do in your spare time, which, I promise, will be filled with coding-for-fun once you are developer. Also, you'll be asked at your job interviews if you are familiar with jQuery. As a front-end developer, you better say yes.
