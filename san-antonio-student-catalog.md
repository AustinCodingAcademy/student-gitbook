## HISTORY and PHILOSOPHY

History
Austin Coding Academy LLC was founded in June of 2014 by Luke Filipos and Christopher Sica with the goal of providing a program designed by the best minds in the industry and taught by professionals in the web development field. We teach a curriculum designed to make you proficient in full stack web development.

What We Mean by Full Stack
Everything you see on the internet has 2 sides to it. A user facing front end with visual text and user interface and a server facing back end that handles all the behind the scenes computations. Depending on the company, a developer might be hired to work on one end or the other, however most companies prefer a developer who has a knowledge of both.

Course Philosophy
Over the course of our program, our goal is to expose you to the skills you need to launch a successful career as a web developer. Our program is divided into Intro, Intermediate and Advanced level classes with an emphasis on teaching you incredible problem solving skills. By the end of the program, you’ll be equipped to be a valuable member of any web development team.

## ADMISSION/ENROLLMENT POLICIES

The minimum age requirement at Austin Coding Academy is 18 years old. Students must have a high school diploma or GED. In order to be qualified for admission, students must pass the ACA Python coding assignment and an essay assignment. The ACA Python coding assignment includes sample code, and students must explain each line of code. If 80% (14 lines) of the lines of code are explained correctly, students pass the ACA Python coding assignment.  Students must also write a 1-2 page essay. A student passes the essay assignment by writing at least 1 page of coherent, grammatically correct text.

Python Coding Assignment

Explain each line of code using the Internet as a resource.

```python
1 first_num = raw_input("Please input first number: ")  
2 sec_num = raw_input("Please input second number: ")  
3  
4 answer = int(first_num) + int(sec_num)  
5  
6 print "Now I will add your two numbers: ", answer  
7  
8 print "Pretty cool, huh?"  
9  
10  print "Now I'll count backwards from ", answer  
11  
12  counter = answer  
13  
14  while (counter >= 0):  
15    print counter  
16    counter = counter - 1  
17  
18  print "All done!"
```

Python Coding Assignment Sample Solution

* Line 1 is defining the variable “first num” to be the raw input, the actual number that is inputted. Also it is a prompt for the user to input the first number.
* Line 2 is defining the variable “sec num” to be the raw input, the actual number that is inputted. Also it is a prompt for the user to input the second number.
* Line 3 is a break.
* Line 4 is defining the variable “answer” to be the sum of the integer for the variable “first num” and the integer for the variable “second num”
* Line 5 is a break
* Line 6 is telling the system to display “No I will add your two numbers:” and leaving a space at the end to put the number which defines the variable “answer” which is the sum of the 2 inputted numbers.
* Line 7 is a break
* Line 8 is telling the system to display “Pretty cool, huh?”
* Line 9 is a break
* Line 10 is telling the system to display “No I’ll count backwards from…the number defining the variable “answer” which is the sum of the 2 inputted numbers.
* Line 11 is a break.
* Line 12 is defining the variable “counter” to be the variable “answer” which is the sum of the 2 inputted numbers.
* Line 13 is a break
* Line 14 is establishing the conditions for the loop function to be while the counter is less than or equal to 0, the loop function will run.
* Line 15 is telling the system to display the number which is the solution to the “counter” variable.
* Line 16 is defining the variable “counter” to be one less than the previous counter.
* Line 14 – 16 is a loop function which counts down from the sum of the 2 inserted numbers. It will stop after 0 because 0-1=-1, and -1 is not >=0.
* Line 17 is a break
* Line 18 is telling the system to display “All done!”


ACA Essay Assignment

Please complete 1 of the 2 essay prompts below. Most students take about two pages to complete the essay, but feel free to extend it as long as you need.
* Where do you see yourself in five years?
* What is an important truth that you believe that very few people agree with you on?

## GRADING SYSTEM, PROGRESS POLICY, AND PROBATION

Our teaching methodology is designed to build learning habits that last well beyond a student’s time with us in class. By valuing questions over answers and process over results in class, we develop students who excel at finding answers and producing results throughout their careers.

GRADING SYSTEM

All assignments are graded. This includes homework, in-class projects, and the final project. Instructors create a rubric for each assignment and use it to assign a grade to each assignment. Grades are stored online using our campus management system called Campus Manager. When students login to Campus Manager, they can see their course average and grade on each assignment.

PROGRESS POLICY

Satisfactory progress means completing all assignments and scoring an average of 70% or higher.
Progress evaluation occurs once a week when instructors grade assignments and share feedback with students. 2-4 times throughout the course, a “checkpoint” is given to students which is equivalent to a test. The checkpoints ensure all students have accomplished all learning objectives. Failure to meet a learning objective will result in a tutoring session. At the end of each subject, students who completed the curriculum will receive a certificate showing they passed the subject and detailing that level of proficiency; additionally, we have an exit consultation with each student to help them figure out the next step, whether that is moving forward on a track with us, continuing their education on their own, launching a project, or finding employment.


PROBATION

* If students do not display satisfactory progress, students will be placed on an improvement plan and work closely with our temporary instructors to improve. Students will be placed on probation for unsatisfactory progress if their course average remains below 70% for 3 weeks and students do not attempt to raise their average by redoing unacceptable assignments.
* A student who remains on probation for 3 weeks and does complete and correct assignments to increase his or her average to 70% or above will be terminated from the class and may not be readmitted until a minimum of one grading period has passed, pursuant to Title 40, Texas Administrative Code, Section 807.221-224.
* Students will be directed to look at their course average once a week and have continuous access to their grades via our Campus Manager application.
* Students will be marked Incomplete if they do not finish all required work for a subject. If students return within 12 months, they may complete the work and receive credit at no additional cost.
* A student who is obligated for the full tuition may request a grade of Incomplete if the student withdraws for an appropriate reason unrelated to the students’ academic status, pursuant to Texas Education Code, Section 132.061(f).
* Students will be marked Withdrawal if they leave the school and give verbal notice that they are not coming back or if they miss 6 consecutive class days.
* Students who do not finish all required assignments and maintain a course average above 70% will be assigned to “Repeat Subject”.
* Students may complete “Remedial Work” to make up for unsatisfactory progress either during a subject or after a subject completion. Their “Remedial Work” will be reviewed and a determination will be made as to whether they will be allowed to continue with the program.

## GRADUATION

* Students are recognized when they complete all 3 subjects: FSWD 101, FSWD 102, or FSWD103 by completing all required work for that subject and maintaining an average at 70% or above.
* Upon completion of the entire program, students will be given a Certificate of Completion.
* A person graduates by completing each of the 3 subjects in the program.

## ATTENDANCE POLICY

Students are expected to attend each of the 60 classes offered over the 30-week period of each subject. All tests missed must be taken on the first day of attendance after the absence. A school shall charge for a full day of absence when the student fails to attend all of the scheduled class on that day. A student who misses more than 10% of class hours will be placed on attendance probation with conditions stipulated by the school director. Enrollment in the program will be terminated for a student who is absent for more than 25% (37.5 hours) of the class hours of the program. Five tardies to class will be counted as one absence. A student whose enrollment was terminated due to unsatisfactory attendance may reenroll on attendance probation in a subsequent term in the next 12 calendar months. Such re-enrollment does not circumvent the approved refund policy. If the reenrolled student on attendance probation is absent for more than 25% of the class hours, the student's enrollment in the program will be terminated, and the student will not be readmitted to the program. This policy will be strictly enforced absent exigent circumstances.

* ACA will not terminate the enrollment of a student for lack of attendance at a point at which a refund would not be due.

## STUDENT CONDUCT POLICY

Students on the ACA campus are expected to behave in a manner that will create a safe and orderly academic environment for themselves and others. Students found in violation of these conduct expectations will be subject to disciplinary action which may include a written warning, dismissal, and/or referral to law enforcement officials. Below is a partial list of inappropriate behaviors that will be subject to disciplinary action. This list is not all-inclusive.

* Academic dishonesty, including any form of plagiarism, cheating, falsification of records, or collaboration with others to defraud
* Actions that disrupt teaching, learning, administration, or interfere with the rights of others.
* Non-compliance with the directives of school faculty and staff
* Violation of written policies, rules, or procedures
* Theft of any kind, and related behaviors such as possessing stolen property or using the property of others without their permission.
* Damage to property or destruction of property
* Creation of unsafe conditions
* Carrying out a false alarm or creating an emergency situation such as a fire or a bomb threat.
* Hurting others, threatening others, or engaging in behavior that may result in harm to others
* Selling, consuming, and/or possessing alcoholic beverages
* Possessing or using drugs not prescribed for the student by a physician; selling any drugs; possessing or using illegal drugs or narcotics
* Possessing a firearm or other deadly or dangerous weapons such as knives, knuckles, clubs, baseball bats, and hammers while on the property of the school or in any part of the school building
* Sexual harassment in any form by students or any member of the administration, faculty, or staff is prohibited. The school is committed to creating and maintaining an environment for all school personnel and students that is free of harassment, forced sexual activity, or any other sexual communication or conduct that interferes with performance in the classroom or the workplace

Sexual Harassment Defined

* Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when:
* submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment,
* submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individuals, or
* such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.

Re-enrollment after Dismissal for Violation of Student Conduct Expectations

After one six-week term has elapsed, a student whose enrollment was terminated for violation of student conduct expectations that did not result in the involvement of law enforcement officials will have one opportunity for re-enrollment in a subsequent term in the next 12 calendar months.

## GRIEVANCES

IT IS THE SCHOOL'S POLICY TO RESOLVE STUDENT GRIEVANCES BY WORKING DIRECTLY WITH  THE STUDENT, INSTRUCTOR, AND OTHER AFFECTED STUDENT(S). STUDENTS WITH UNRESOLVED GRIEVANCES MAY CONTACT:

Texas Workforce Commission
Career Schools and Colleges, Room 226T
101 East 15th Street

## PLACEMENT ASSISTANCE POLICY

Job placement assistance is available at no charge for all students who are awarded the Advanced Class Certificate of Completion. ACA consistently builds and maintains relationships with employers looking to hire web developers and connects those employers with the appropriate students. ACA also has a jobs board where it posts currently hiring companies and their available positions. Students are encouraged to apply to jobs through that portal. Additionally, ACA does career readiness events like interview and resumé preparation seminars. While the ACA team takes great pride in the ACA graduates working in the web development industry, neither the school, its board, administration, or any faculty or staff member can guarantee employment.

## APPENDIX 1: CANCELLATION AND REFUND POLICIES


### CANCELLATION POLICY

A full refund will be made to any student who cancels the enrollment contract within 72 hours (until midnight of the third day excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) after the enrollment contract is signed. If the student is not scheduled for three class days during the first week, a full refund will be made to any student who cancels enrollment within the student’s first three scheduled class days, except that the school may retain not more than $100 in any administrative fees charged and items of extra expense that are necessary for the portion of the program attended and stated separately on the enrollment agreement.

### REFUND POLICY

1.  Refund computations will be based on scheduled course time of classes through the last documented day of an academically related activity. Leaves of absence, suspensions and school holidays will not be counted as part of the scheduled classes.
1.  The effective date of termination for refund purposes will be the earliest of the following:
  1.   the date of termination, if the student is terminated by the school;
  1.   the date of receipt of written notice from the student; or
  1.  the first of the following dates when the student’s participation in an academically related activity cannot be documented: at the end of the first week of each academic term, at the end of the first month of each academic term, at the midpoint of each academic term, and at the end of each academic term.
1.  If tuition and fees are collected in advance of entrance, and if after expiration of the 72 hour cancellation privilege the student does not enter school, not more than $100 in any administrative fees charged shall be retained by the school for the entire residence program.
1.  If a student enters a residence and withdraws or is otherwise terminated, the school or college may retain not more than $100 in administrative fees charged for the entire program. The minimum refund of the remaining tuition and fees will be the pro rata portion of tuition, fees, and other charges that the number of hours remaining in the portion of the course or program for which the student has been charged after the effective date of termination bears to the total number of hours in the portion of the course or program for which the student has been charged, except that a student may not collect a refund if the student has completed 75 percent or more of the total number of hours in the portion of the program for which the student has been charged on the effective date of termination.
1.  Refunds for items of extra expense to the student, such as books, tools, or other supplies should be handled separately from refund of tuition and other academic fees. The student will not be required to purchase instructional supplies, books and tools until such time as these materials are required. Once these materials are purchased, no refund will be made. For full refunds, the school can withhold costs for these types of items from the refund as long as they were necessary for the portion of the program attended and separately stated in the enrollment agreement. Any such items not required for the portion of the program attended must be included in the refund.
1.  A student who withdraws for a reason unrelated to the student’s academic status after the 75 percent completion mark and requests a grade at the time of withdrawal shall be given a grade of “incomplete” and permitted to reenroll in the course or program during the 12-month period following the date the student withdrew without payment of additional tuition for that portion of the course or program.
1.  A full refund of all tuition and fees is due and refundable in each of the following cases:
  1.  an enrollee is not accepted by the school;
  1.  if the course of instruction is discontinued by the school and this prevents the student from completing the course; or
  1.  if the student's enrollment was procured as a result of any misrepresentation in advertising, promotional materials of the school, or representations by the owner or representatives of the school.

A full or partial refund may also be due in other circumstances of program deficiencies or violations of requirements for career schools and colleges.

### REFUND POLICY FOR STUDENTS CALLED TO ACTIVE MILITARY SERVICE

1.  A student of the school or college who withdraws from the school or college as a result of the student being called to active duty in a military service of the United States or the Texas National Guard may elect one of the following options for each program in which the student is enrolled:
  1.  if tuition and fees are collected in advance of the withdrawal, a pro rata refund of any tuition, fees, or other charges paid by the student for the program and a cancellation of any unpaid tuition, fees, or other charges owed by the student for the portion of the program the student does not complete following withdrawal;
  1.  a grade of incomplete with the designation "withdrawn-military" for the courses in the program, other than courses for which the student has previously received a grade on the student's transcript, and the right to re-enroll in the program, or a substantially equivalent program if that program is no longer available, not later than the first anniversary of the date the student is discharged from active military duty without payment of additional tuition, fees, or other charges for the program other than any previously unpaid balance of the original tuition, fees, and charges for books for the program; or
  1.  the assignment of an appropriate final grade or credit for the courses in the program, but only if the instructor or instructors of the program determine that the student has: (1)
    1.  satisfactorily completed at least 90 percent of the required coursework for the program; and
    1.  demonstrated sufficient mastery of the program material to receive credit for completing the program.
1.  The payment of refunds will be totally completed such that the refund instrument has been negotiated or credited into the proper account(s) within 60 days after the effective date of termination.
