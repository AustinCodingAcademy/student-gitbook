# ACA DevTeam

Lack of industry experience will be your biggest hurdle after graduating from ACA. To supplement that part of your resume, we offer you the chance to work with us! We have plenty of projects and tasks that you can test your skills against and learn something new. Whether it's building a [GitBook Plugin](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/plugin-tonic-aca) to share with the world, development work on our [ACA Jobs Board](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/aca-jobs), or implementing new features and bug-fixes on our homegrown [Campus Manager](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/campus-manager) app. All work will be open-source and shared with the world (and with your next interviewer).

## Who Should Apply?

While the internship program is directed toward ACA graduates, there is usually some work that needs to be done at any level. It is important that you do not over commit yourself, and that it does not interfere with your coursework. Interns will have the advantage of working at Capital Factory with a mentor nearby, and are encouraged to do so. You may work remotely from home, but you will be expected to deliver what was expected on time.

## How Will It Be Organized?

As a functioning development team, we will be using tools you will commonly find on the job. We have a [kanban-style](https://waffle.io/AustinCodingAcademy/campus-manager) board where interns can pick work that interests or challenges them.

## Is There Any Compensation?

The majority of the work is open-source and unpaid. This is a chance to invest in yourself and gain experience.

## How Much Time Should I Contribute?

As much as you can. This is not an exercise to over-stress yourself, but one where you can test how accountability affects your productivity. This internship should not get in the way of interviewing for jobs, and certainly not your health. These projects, bugs, and features are not pre-solved for you. Time and time again, you will have to break down an issue by:

  1. Learning how the present codebase works
  1. Reverse engineering the issue to trace it to its root
  1. Tweaking the code, probably breaking it a few times
  1. Eventually figuring out the right solution
  1. Testing for unintended side affects
  1. Submit a Pull Request and wait for a Code Review
  1. Lather, Rinse, Repeat
