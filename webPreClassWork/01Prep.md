# Step 1 - Prepare your Machine
<!-- This is how each subject should be introduced. Give the students structure so they know they can start trusting the process sooner!  -->
You'll need 3 essential tool on your machine(computer): a **web browser**, a **text editor**, and a **terminal**, or **terminal emulator** (a.k.a. Command Line Interface(CLI)).

### Read It 
<!-- Give them our writting of the subject then link to a few articles: Medium, Wikipedia, CSS-Tricks, W3S, MozillaDev, etc... that help give more perspective on the subject  -->
* Sure you can surf with Internet Explore, Edge, Opera, Firefox or Safari but Chrome has undoubtedly the strongest built in devTools of all browsers. Be sure to download [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) so you give yourself the best advantage possible and start reading up on its power.(Don't worry if this [article](https://medium.com/frontmen/art-of-debugging-with-chrome-devtools-ab7b5fd8e0b4) is a little dense. Just keep it in the back of your mind so when we cover debugging in Chrome you have it as a learning tool to be a Chrome DevTool Ninja!)

* A text editor is just that, a text editor. It is used to edit and contain your code into files before they are executed. There are plenty text editors or IDEs including Atom, SublimeText, IntelliJ, Brackets, WebStorm, VIM, TextWrangler, RubyMine and even NotePad. Some are paid, others are free but for our use-case and to get the most powerful text editor for the buck we're going to use the free and well supported [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Be sure to download it and then [read up](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/mac-text-editors/) on other text editors as you grow as a developer. 

* Think of the terminal or CLI(Command-Line Interface) as a short-cut to the computer. Normally we access our computer's programs and files through a GUI(Graphical User Interface(pronounced: "gooey")). This way is nice and pretty but sometimes we need to access the computer more directly and make it work faster. We can do this using the Command-Line.
    1. If you are using a macOS you have a built in terminal, simply hold **command** + **spacebar** then type in "terminal" + **enter**.
    2. If you are using a Windows machine pre-Windows 10 then you will need to download [gitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) to work as your terminal emulator. See: [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).
    3. If you are using a Windows machine with Windows 10+ then you can use the build-in [Command Prompt](https://www.lifewire.com/command-prompt-2625840).
* We will use these terminals or terminal emulators later in the course. For now, just make sure you have them.
