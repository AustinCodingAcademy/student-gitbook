# Step 2 - Playing with code in a sandbox!
<!-- This is how each subject should be introduced. Give the students structure so they know they can start trusting the process sooner!  -->

### Read It 
<!-- Give them our writting of the subject then link to a few articles: Medium, Wikipedia, CSS-Tricks, W3S, MozillaDev, etc... that help give more perspective on the subject  -->
Code sandboxes are really useful tool to share ideas, play with possibilites and explore new ideas without the pressures of building your file structure, setting up your machine or depending on the console. In class we'll use [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) to share snippets of code, give you a place to practice and find new things. Get in the habit of browsing and playing with CodePens as you work through the textbook. Its where "the rubber meets ther road", so to speak. CodePens are where you actually get to apply the concepts you just read or watched about PLUS, you will frequently use them in your new career.

There are plenty of sandboxes to play in. [Repl.it](https://repl.it/login?goto=%2Frepls), [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/?html,js,output), [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) and [more](https://www.sitepoint.com/7-code-playgrounds/)! Get dirty and explore for yourself! 

### See It
<!-- Can be a video on youTube as long as it doesn't go to another code school. Eventually all video content should come from ACA. -->
* For now checkout this cool [codepen](https://codepen.io/issey/pen/brmoZa) and explore the CodePen Community.
