# Step 8 - Starting Your Blog

<!-- This is how each subject should be introduced. Give the students structure so they know they can start trusting the process sooner!  -->

Many benefits spring from starting your own blog! To enumerate: establishing and building-up your online presence, reflecting on your own learning and engraining the value, sharing and connecting with others, contributing your lessons to the community, expressing yourself and recording your thoughts in a place you can easily return to as well as send to others (potential employers) when needed.

In class we will use your blog for all of these reason but specifically to record your thoughts and lessons, share them with your instructor and **Prepare you for the rigors of developer interviews to come**.

### Read On

<!-- Give them our writting of the subject then link to a few articles: Medium, Wikipedia, CSS-Tricks, W3S, MozillaDev, etc... that help give more perspective on the subject  -->
Progressing through the material and challenges set forth in this web-based textbook will certainly teach you new skills and establish a baseline of knowledge from which you will be able to continue growing upon. However, in our limited time together we cannot cover all of the material in which you might be questioned on in an interview.

To ensure you and all of our students are constantly improving upon your skills and knowledge base as a whole, at the end of each of your class days there will be a set of questions entitled: *Interview Questions*. The purpose of these questions is to provide you with questions pertaining to deeper topics that might not have been able to be covered while learning the hard-skills of coding and programming or the soft-skills of presenting.

If you don't know the answers to these questions...PERFECT! This is your chance to learn them! You are expected and will be graded each week on your blog post that answers these question. Use google. Search for the terms in the questions and read as much as you can find. Once you understand the terms and ideas, synthesize the answers to the questions in your weekly blog.

The practice of blogging every week will do countless things for you all at the same time, without you knowing or understanding why. Simply covering new material, pushing your upper-limits and converting your new ideas into words will cultivate your ability to speak about them which will prepare you to speak about code in interviews. It will slowly yet rapidly build your knowledge of different challenges and solution-based approaches and record them in a place for you to return to when you are preparing for interviews as a study guide...in your own words!!

The final reason you should be happy to be writing a weekly blog is that in-order for you to move on to the next course you will need to pass the Exit Test of this course. The questions to this test are pulled from the *Interview Questions* you answer each week. This is a win-win for you all the way around!
