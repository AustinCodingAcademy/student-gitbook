# Step 5 - Search Engine Optimization(SEO) and Accessibility
<!-- This is how each subject should be introduced. Give the students structure so they know they can start trusting the process sooner!  -->

As you move along through this course and the following ones we will be giving you many topics for you to learn about. You will not need to know everything about every single one, *no developer does*, but it is important to know that most developers are hired for specific skills. Some are excellent security specialists, architects, back-end wizards, front-end designers, mobile gurus and some are hired to make sure the company's site is picked up on Google search results and other make sure the company stays legal and in-line with the American's with Disabilities Act. Read on to learn more about these last two specialities. 


### Read It - Accessibility
<!-- Give them our writting of the subject then link to a few articles: Medium, Wikipedia, CSS-Tricks, W3S, MozillaDev, etc... that help give more perspective on the subject  -->

Many of us only consume the web through the web browser, but there is a significant portion of the world that does not. Many users rely on screen readers,  monochrome displays or other assistant technologies. Others will expect a page to be printer-friendly in order for it to be of any use. In these cases we not only concern our design sensibilities with how content is presented, but with how it is _structured_. We compose our HTML _semantically_ so that it renders accurately across a range of browsing platforms - even before adding any CSS styling.

[UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design) concerns itself not only with making websites beautiful, but providing a structured approach to designing practical, universally intuitive user interaction. The keyword here is *'universally'*; one important consideration UX designers account for is **accessibility** - particularly **colorblindness**. A particular company's website might look fantastic, but a problematic color scheme could effectively alienate a significant percentage of potential viewers - about [**8% of all men, and about 1% of all women**.](http://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/)

The way we structure our webpages is also really important for how Google will rank them in search results. This may seem like a no brainer but ther is a significant science behind how webpages are ranked and companies pay a lot of money to people that know how to optimize for search engines. 

Don't get to bogged down in [SEO](https://searchenginewatch.com/2016/01/21/seo-basics-22-essentials-you-need-for-optimizing-your-site/) and Accessibility right now, just look these article over and know about the subjects. That way you can have an [understanding](https://blog.alexa.com/semantic-seo-how-to-change-your-game-to-win-in-search/) of why you need to structure your webpages the way you do later on.
