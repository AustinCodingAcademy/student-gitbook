# Step 4 - Intro to the Web
<!-- This is how each subject should be introduced. Give the students structure so they know they can start trusting the process sooner!  -->
In this class you'll be learning how to code the layout of what you see on your computer's screen when you request a page on the internet. We will begin by exploring the "front-end" of the internet; which is to say the pretty graphics, buttons, forms, pictures and text you see on any webpage you've ever been on. As you progress through to graduation you will learn more and more about the "back-end".

### Read It 
<!-- Give them our writting of the subject then link to a few articles: Medium, Wikipedia, CSS-Tricks, W3S, MozillaDev, etc... that help give more perspective on the subject  -->
To keep all of this in context lets first cover a few key terms you will hear bandied about in the tech world:

The [Client-side](https://www.sqa.org.uk/e-learning/ClientSide01CD/page_18.htm) refers to your personal computer or machine's web browser, i.e. Chrome or Firefox.

[Front-End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development) refers to converting data from the back-end to a graphical user interface (GUI, for short (pronounced "Gooey")) for users to view and interact with the data in a presentational way like you're doing right now...! The common languages and really, only languages used for this are: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We'll cover each of these in this course.If your interested in a what a front-end dev does, look [here](https://medium.com/tech-tajawal/modern-frontend-developer-in-2018-4c2072fa2b9c).

[Back-End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends) refers to the code written strictly to access, handle and manipulate data on the [server-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting). This is where all the "magic happens". Without the back-end the front-end is only a pretty moving picture. But with the back-end the front-end is an intereactive world we can interact with millions of people and read and watch endless content. For a better understanding of the what a back-end dev does checkout this [article](https://medium.com/tech-tajawal/modern-backend-developer-in-2018-6b3f7b5f8b9).

Back to our [introduction to the web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works): a server(where the back-end code is executed) hold files at certain addresses and our web browsers can request access to those files through URL addresses, thus the servers serve our client-side browsers files. Its really as simple as that. 

Soon you'll be serving up files from your local machine, we cleverly call this "locally served"(hahaha!) and opening it in your browser. This is a common practice across the industry because it allows you to quickly adjust your code and see it in nearly live time.
